# Farmer job
Farmer job for fivem,
You can **only** download this script from my [Github](https://github.com/IDark-AngelI/)

Unfortunately, the notifications of this script are written in Persian and if you want the script to be in English, you have to translate the notifications yourself! (Database names and others are English so you need to translate notifications only)

# Dependencies
1) essentialmode
2) esx_jobs
# Installation
1) Add " 'client/jobs/farmer.lua', " into "client_scripts" in "esx_jobs\_resource.lua
2) Move "farmer.lua" in "esx_jobs\client\jobs"
3) Copy Paste "locales/en.txt" content into "esx_jobs\locales\en.lua"
4) Add db.sql into your Database
5) Move "img" folder contents to "esx_inventoryhud\html\img\items"
6) Enjoy!
